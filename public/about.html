<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Nancy - a student currently diving deep into web development and design.
  I enjoy turning into clean, interactive, and user-friendly websites using HTML, 
  CSS, and JavaScript. My journey into tech is fueled by curiosity and the 
  excitement of solving problems in creative ways.
</p>
<p>
  Outside the screen, I'm passionate about activities that build focus and 
  discipline, like learning new languages and practicing dance. These hobbies keep
  me balanced, improve my communication skills, and give me a unique perspective
  when approaching new challenges.
</p>
<p>
  My goal is to grow as a software developer, contriute to impactful projects, and
  collaborate with people who are as excited about learning and building as I am.
